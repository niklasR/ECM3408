    \section{SQLite Database Creation} ew
    The following commands can be used to create a table called \texttt{documents}
    
    \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily]
$ sqlite3 skydrive.sqlite3
sqlite > CREATE TABLE documents
    ...> ( id INT PRIMARY KEY 
    ...> , name VARCHAR
    ...> , message VARCHAR ); # sqlite does not impose length-limits on fields, so none is given.
.quit
    \end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Testing}
	Script output of creating a database as described above, storing an unencrypted message and retrieving it:
	\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily]
bash-3.2$ sqlite3 skydrive.sqlite3
SQLite version 3.8.5 2014-08-15 22:37:57
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> CREATE TABLE documents
   ...> ( id INT PRIMARY KEY
   ...> , name VARCHAR
   ...> , message VARCHAR );
sqlite> INSERT INTO documents VALUES
   ...> (1, "Name", "Message");
sqlite> SELECT * FROM documents;
1|Name|Message
sqlite>
\end{lstlisting}
